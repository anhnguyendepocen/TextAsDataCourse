                    Migration and Development

              Declaration of the High-level Dialogue on International Migration
              and Development
                    We, representatives of States and Governments, gathered at United Nations
              Headquarters in New York on 3 and 4 October 2013 on the occasion of the High-
              level Dialogue on International Migration and Development,
                   1.   Recognize that international migration is a multidimensional reality of
              major relevance for the development of countries of origin, transit and destination,
              and in this regard recognize that international migration is a cross-cutting
              phenomenon that should be addressed in a coherent, comprehensive and balanced
              manner, integrating development with due regard for social, economic and
              environmental dimensions and respecting human rights;
                    2.    Acknowledge the important contribution made by migrants and migration
              to development in countries of origin, transit and destination, as well as the complex
              interrelationship between migration and development;
                    3.   Decide to work towards an effective and inclusive agenda on
              international migration that integrates development and respects human rights by
              improving the performance of existing institutions and frameworks, as well as
              partnering more effectively with all stakeholders involved in international migration
              and development at the regional and global levels;
                    4.    Reaffirm our commitment to address the opportunities and the challenges
              that international migration presents to countries of origin, transit and destination;
                   5.    Recognize the need for international cooperation to address, in a holistic
              and comprehensive manner, the challenges of irregular migration to ensure safe,
              orderly and regular migration, with full respect for human rights;

                  6.    Recognize the need to strengthen synergies between international
             migration and development at the global, regional and national levels;
                   7.    Recognize the efforts made by the international community in addressing
             relevant aspects of international migration and development, through different
             initiatives, both within the United Nations system and in other processes,
             particularly the Global Forum on Migration and Development and regional
             processes, as well as in drawing on the expertise of the International Organization
             for Migration and other member agencies of the Global Migration Group;
                  8.    Acknowledge the important contribution of migration in realizing the
             Millennium Development Goals, and recognize that human mobility is a key factor
             for sustainable development which should be adequately considered in the
             elaboration of the post-2015 development agenda;
                  9.   Acknowledge the important role that migrants play as partners in the
             development of countries of origin, transit and destination and recognize the need to
             improve public perceptions of migrants and migration;
                   10. Reaffirm the need to promote and protect effectively the human rights
             and fundamental freedoms of all migrants, regardless of their migration status,
             especially those of women and children, and to address international migration
             through international, regional or bilateral cooperation and dialogue and through a
             comprehensive and balanced approach, recognizing the roles and responsibilities of
             countries of origin, transit and destination in promoting and protecting the human
             rights of all migrants, and avoiding approaches that might aggravate their
             vulnerability;
                   11. Recognize that women and girls account for almost half of all
             international migrants at the global level, and the need to address the special
             situation and vulnerability of migrant women and girls by, inter alia, incorporating a
             gender perspective into policies and strengthening national laws, institutions and
             programmes to combat gender-based violence, including trafficking in persons and
             discrimination against women and girls;
                   12. Emphasize in this regard the need to establish appropriate measures for
             the protection of women migrant workers in all sectors, including those involved in
             domestic work;
                   13. Express the commitment to protect the human rights of migrant children,
             given their vulnerability, particularly unaccompanied migrant children, and to
             provide for their health, education and psychosocial development, ensuring that the
             best interests of the child are a primary consideration in policies of integration,
             return and family reunification;
                  14. Emphasize the need to respect and promote international labour
             standards as appropriate, and respect the rights of migrants in their workplaces;
                   15. Note the contribution of applicable international conventions, including
             the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers
             and Members of Their Families, 1 to the international system for the protection of
             migrants;

                     16. Strongly condemn the acts, manifestations and expressions of racism,
               racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance against migrants and the
               stereotypes often applied to them, including on the basis of religion or belief, and
               urge States to apply and, where needed, reinforce the existing laws when
               xenophobic or intolerant acts, manifestations or expressions against migrants occur,
               in order to eradicate impunity for those who commit those acts;
                     17. Reiterate our commitment to prevent and combat trafficking in persons,
               protect victims of trafficking, prevent and combat migrant smuggling and protect
               migrants from exploitation and other abuses, stress the need to establish or upgrade,
               as appropriate, national and regional anti-human trafficking policies and to reinforce
               cooperation on prevention, the prosecution of traffickers and the protection of
               victims of trafficking, and encourage Member States to ratify, accede to and
               implement relevant international instruments on preventing and combating
               trafficking in persons and smuggling of migrants;
                     18. Encourage Member States to cooperate on mobility programmes that
               facilitate safe, orderly and regular migration, including through labour mobility;
                    19. Recognize the particular vulnerabilities, circumstances and needs of
               adolescents and young migrants, as well as their potential to build social, economic
               and cultural bridges of cooperation and understanding across societies;
                     20. Recognize also all efforts made by Governments, all relevant bodies,
               agencies, funds and programmes of the United Nations system, other relevant
               intergovernmental, regional and subregional organizations, including the International
               Organization for Migration and other organizations within the Global Migration
               Group, and non-governmental stakeholders, including the private sector, in addressing
               international migration and development for the benefit of both migrants and
               societies; and bearing this goal in mind, further emphasize the need to strengthen
               partnerships among all relevant stakeholders;
                     21. Stress the need to deepen the interaction between Governments and civil
               society to find responses to the challenges and the opportunities posed by
               international migration, and recognize the contribution of civil society, including
               non-governmental organizations, to promoting the well-being of migrants and their
               integration into societies, especially at times of extreme vulnerable conditions, and
               the support of the international community to the efforts of such organizations;
                    22. Acknowledge the complexity of migratory flows and that international
               migration movements also occur within the same geographical regions, and in this
               context call for a better understanding of migration patterns across and within regions;
                     23. Recognize the importance of coordinated efforts of the international
               community to assist and support migrants stranded in vulnerable situations and
               facilitate, and cooperate on when appropriate, their voluntary return to their country
               of origin, and call for practical and action-oriented initiatives aimed at identifying
               and closing protection gaps;
                    24. Underline the right of migrants to return to their country of citizenship,
               and recall that States must ensure that their returning nationals are duly received;
                     25. Recognize the need to consider the role that environmental factors may
               play in migration;
                     26. Recognize the necessity to consider how the migration of highly skilled
               persons, especially in the health, social and engineering sectors, affects the
               development efforts of developing countries, and emphasize the need to consider
               circular migration;

                                                                                                                 3/4

                   27. Recognize that remittances constitute an important source of private
             capital, and reaffirm the need to promote conditions for cheaper, faster and safer
             transfers of remittances in both source and recipient countries;
                   28. Emphasize the need for reliable statistical data on international
             migration, including, when possible, on the contributions of migrants to
             development in both countries of origin and countries of destination; this data could
             facilitate the design of evidence-based policy- and decision-making in all relevant
             aspects of sustainable development;
                  29. Acknowledge that the Global Forum on Migration and Development has
             proved to be a valuable forum for holding frank and open discussions and that it has
             helped to build trust among participating stakeholders through the exchange of
             experiences and good practices and by virtue of its voluntary, informal State-led
             character;
                  30. Acknowledge that the United Nations system can benefit from the
             discussions and outcomes of the Global Forum on Migration and Development, in
             order to maximize the benefits of international migration for development;
                   31. Call upon all relevant bodies, agencies, funds and programmes of the
             United Nations system, other relevant intergovernmental, regional and subregional
             organizations, including the International Organization for Migration and other Global
             Migration Group members, and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General
             on International Migration and Development, within their respective mandates, to
             strengthen their collaboration and cooperation to better and fully address the issue of
             international migration and development, in order to adopt a coherent, comprehensive
             and coordinated approach, and to consider migration issues in their contributions to
             the preparatory process that will establish the post-2015 development agenda;
                   32. Welcome the recent efforts made by the Global Migration Group to take
             measures to enhance its functioning and to promote coherence and coordination
             among its member organizations, and in this regard stress the importance of regular
             interaction between the Group and Member States;
                   33. Request the Secretary-General to continue his substantive work on
             international migration and development and, in collaboration with the United
             Nations system and relevant organizations, including the International Organization
             for Migration, to continue to assess the progress made in the field of migration and
             development;
                   34. Also request the Secretary-General, in the elaboration of his report on
             international migration and development to be submitted to the General Assembly at
             its sixty-ninth session, to give due consideration to the results and deliberations of
             this High-level Dialogue.

                                                                                25th plenary meeting
                                                                                     3 October 2013
